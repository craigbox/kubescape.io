You can adjust the configuration of this control to suit your specific environment. [Read the documentation on configuring controls](../../frameworks-and-controls/configuring-controls/) to learn more.

* [Values](../../frameworks-and-controls/configuring-controls/#sensitivevalues): Strings that identify a value that Kubescape believes should be stored in a Secret, and not in a ConfigMap or an environment variable.

* [Keys](../../frameworks-and-controls/configuring-controls/#sensitivekeynames): Key names that identify a potential value that should be stored in a Secret, and not in a ConfigMap or an environment variable.

* [AllowedValues](../../frameworks-and-controls/configuring-controls/#sensitivevaluesallowed): Explicitly allowed values, which will override sensitiveValues.
