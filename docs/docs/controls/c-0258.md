## What does this control test
Check if any workload has mounted secrets by inspecting their specifications and verifying if secret volumes are defined
## Remediation
Review the workloads identified by this control and assess whether it's necessary to mount these configMaps. Remove configMaps access from workloads that don't require it or ensure appropriate access controls are in place to protect sensitive information.
## Example
