## Prerequisites
Kubescape must be run with the [host scanner enabled](/docs/scanning/#the-host-scanner) to use this control.
## Framework
cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
## Severity
Medium
## Description of the the issue
The etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `etcd` service in the master node. etcd is a highly-available key-value store which Kubernetes uses for persistent storage of all of its REST API object. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## What does this control test
Ensure that the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
## How to check it manually
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml

```
 Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
## Remediation
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml

```
### Impact Statement
None
### Default Value
By default, `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
## Example
No example
