## Framework
cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
## Severity
Medium
## Description of the the issue
If `--service-account-lookup` is not enabled, the apiserver only verifies that the authentication token is valid, and does not validate that the service account token mentioned in the request is actually present in etcd. This allows using a service account token even after the corresponding service account is deleted. This is an example of time of check to time of use security issue.
## Related resources
Pod
## What does this control test
Validate service account before validating token.
## How to check it manually
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that if the `--service-account-lookup` argument exists it is set to `true`.
## Remediation
Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the below parameter.

 
```
--service-account-lookup=true

```
 Alternatively, you can delete the `--service-account-lookup` parameter from this file so that the default takes effect.
### Impact Statement
None
### Default Value
By default, `--service-account-lookup` argument is set to `true`.
