## Framework
cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
## Severity
High
## Description of the the issue
The apiserver, by default, does not authenticate itself to the kubelet's HTTPS endpoints. The requests from the apiserver are treated anonymously. You should set up certificate-based kubelet authentication to ensure that the apiserver authenticates itself to kubelets when submitting requests.
## Related resources
Pod
## What does this control test
Enable certificate based kubelet authentication.
## How to check it manually
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that the `--kubelet-client-certificate` and `--kubelet-client-key` arguments exist and they are set as appropriate.
## Remediation
Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set up the TLS connection between the apiserver and kubelets. Then, edit API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the kubelet client certificate and key parameters as below.

 
```
--kubelet-client-certificate=<path/to/client-certificate-file>
--kubelet-client-key=<path/to/client-key-file>

```
### Impact Statement
You require TLS to be configured on apiserver as well as kubelets.
### Default Value
By default, certificate-based kubelet authentication is not set.
## Example
No example
