## Framework
cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
## Severity
Medium
## Description of the the issue
The Controller Manager API service which runs on port 10252/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster's attack surface
## Related resources
Pod
## What does this control test
Do not bind the Controller Manager service to non-loopback insecure addresses.
## How to check it manually
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager

```
 Verify that the `--bind-address` argument is set to 127.0.0.1
## Remediation
Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` on the Control Plane node and ensure the correct value for the `--bind-address` parameter
### Impact Statement
None
### Default Value
By default, the `--bind-address` parameter is set to 0.0.0.0
## Example
No example
