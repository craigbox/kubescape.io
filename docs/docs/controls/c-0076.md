# C-0076: Label usage for resources

## Frameworks
* DevOpsBest
* AllControls
 
## Severity
Low

## Description of the issue
It is recommended to set labels that identify semantic attributes of your application or deployment. For example, { app: myapp, tier: frontend, phase: test, deployment: v3 }. These labels can used to assign policies to logical groups of the deployments as well as for presentation and tracking purposes. This control helps you find deployments without any of the expected labels. Note, [this control is configurable](#configuration-parameters).

## What this control tests 
Test will check if a certain set of labels is defined, this is a configurable control. Initial list: app, tier, phase, version, owner, env.
 
## Remediation
Define labels that are most suitable to your needs of use the exceptions to prevent further notifications.
 
## Configuration parameters 
 You can adjust the configuration of this control to suit your specific environment. [Read the documentation on configuring controls](../frameworks-and-controls/configuring-controls.md) to learn more.
 
* [recommendedLabels](../frameworks-and-controls/configuring-controls.md#recommendedlabels):
Kubescape checks that workloads have at least one label that identifies semantic attributes.
