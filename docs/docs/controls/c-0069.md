## Prerequisites
Kubescape must be run with the [host scanner enabled](/docs/scanning/#the-host-scanner) to use this control.
## Framework
AllControls, ArmoBest, NSA, MITRE

Critical
## Description of the the issue
By default, requests to the kubelet's HTTPS endpoint that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests, and given a username of system:anonymous and a group of system:unauthenticated.

## What does this control test
Reading the kubelet command lines and configuration file looking for anonymous-auth configuration. If this configuration is set on both, the command line values take precedence over it.
## Remediation
Start the kubelet with the --anonymous-auth=false flag.
## Example
No example
