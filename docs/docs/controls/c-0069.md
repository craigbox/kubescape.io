# C-0069: Disable anonymous access to Kubelet service

## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Frameworks
* MITRE
* NSA
* AllControls
* ArmoBest
 
## Severity
Critical

## Description of the issue
By default, requests to the kubelet's HTTPS endpoint that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests, and given a username of system:anonymous and a group of system:unauthenticated.
 
## What this control tests 
Reading the kubelet command lines and configuration file looking for anonymous-auth configuration. If this configuration is set on both, the command line values take precedence over it.
 
## Remediation
Start the kubelet with the --anonymous-auth=false flag.
