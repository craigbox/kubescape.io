# C-0007: Data Destruction

## Frameworks
* MITRE
* ClusterScan
* AllControls
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
Attackers may attempt to destroy data and resources in the cluster. This includes deleting deployments, configurations, storage, and compute resources.
 
## Related resources
ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, Role, RoleBinding
 
## What this control tests 
Check which subjects have delete/deletecollection RBAC permissions on workloads.
 
## Remediation
You should follow the least privilege principle and minimize the number of subjects that can delete resources.
 
## Example
```
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-exec
rules:
- apiGroups: ["*"]
  resources: ["secrets","pods","services","depolyments","replicasets","deamonsets","stateflsets","jobs,"cronjobs"]  # we look for one of these resources or *
  verbs: ["delete","deletecollection"]	    # we look for one of these verbs or * 	




```
