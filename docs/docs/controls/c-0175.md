## Prerequisites
Kubescape must be run with the [host scanner enabled](../scanning.md#the-host-scanner) to use this control.
## Framework
cis-aks-t1.2.0, cis-eks-t1.2.0, cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
## Severity
Medium
## Description of the the issue
The Kubelet process provides a read-only API in addition to the main Kubelet API. Unauthenticated access is provided to this read-only API which could possibly retrieve potentially sensitive information about the cluster.
## Related resources

## What does this control test
Disable the read-only port.
## How to check it manually
Run the following command on each node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kubelet

```
 Verify that the `--read-only-port` argument exists and is set to `0`.

 If the `--read-only-port` argument is not present, check that there is a Kubelet config file specified by `--config`. Check that if there is a `readOnlyPort` entry in the file, it is set to `0`.
## Remediation
If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `readOnlyPort` to `0`.

 If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS` variable.

 
```
--read-only-port=0

```
 Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:

 
```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

```
### Impact Statement
Removal of the read-only port will require that any service which made use of it will need to be re-configured to use the main Kubelet API.
### Default Value
By default, `--read-only-port` is set to `10255/TCP`. However, if a config file is specified by `--config` the default value for `readOnlyPort` is 0.
