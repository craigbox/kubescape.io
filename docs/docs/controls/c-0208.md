# C-0208: Consider external secret storage

## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Frameworks
* cis-aks-t1.2.0
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
Kubernetes supports secrets as first-class objects, but care needs to be taken to ensure that access to secrets is carefully limited. Using an external secrets provider can ease the management of access to secrets, especially where secrets are used across both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes environments.
 
## What this control tests 
Checking encryption configuration to see if secrets are managed externally by kms using aws, azure, or akeyless vault
 
## How to check it manually 
Review your secrets management implementation.
 
## Remediation
Refer to the secrets management options offered by your cloud provider or a third-party secrets management solution.
 
### Impact Statement
None
 
### Default Value
By default, no external secret management is configured.
