## Severity
Medium
## Description of the the issue
The `kubelet` service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `kubelet` service in the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

Ensure that the `kubelet` service file has permissions of `600` or more restrictive.
## How to check it manually
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

 
```
stat -c %a /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf

```
 Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.
## Remediation
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

 
```
chmod 600 /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/kubeadm.conf

```
