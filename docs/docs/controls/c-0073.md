## Severity
Low
## Description of the the issue
It is not recommended to create PODs without parental Deployment, ReplicaSet, StatefulSet etc.Manual creation if PODs may lead to a configuration drifts and other untracked changes in the system. Such PODs won't be automatically rescheduled by Kubernetes in case of a crash or infrastructure failure. This control identifies every POD that does not have corresponding parental object.

## What does this control test
Test if PODs are not associated with Deployment, ReplicaSet etc. If not, fail.
## Remediation
Create necessary Deployment object for every POD making any POD a first class citizen in your IaC architecture.
## Example
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```
