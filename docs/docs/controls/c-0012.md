## Framework
ClusterScan, AllControls, ArmoBest, NSA, WorkloadScan, MITRE
## Severity
High
## Description of the the issue
Developers store secrets in the Kubernetes configuration files, such as environment variables in the pod configuration. Such behavior is commonly seen in clusters that are monitored by Azure Security Center. Attackers who have access to those configurations, by querying the API server or by accessing those files on the developerâ€™s endpoint, can steal the stored secrets and use them.Note, this control is configurable. See below the details.

## What does this control test

## Remediation
Use Kubernetes secrets or Key Management Systems to store credentials.
