# C-0242: Hostile multi-tenant workloads

## Frameworks

## Severity

## Description of the issue

 
## What this control tests 
Currently, Kubernetes environments aren't safe for hostile multi-tenant usage. Extra security features, like Pod Security Policies or Kubernetes RBAC for nodes, efficiently block exploits. For true security when running hostile multi-tenant workloads, only trust a hypervisor. The security domain for Kubernetes becomes the entire cluster, not an individual node.

 For these types of hostile multi-tenant workloads, you should use physically isolated clusters. For more information on ways to isolate workloads, see Best practices for cluster isolation in AKS.
