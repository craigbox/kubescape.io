## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
The API Server, can be configured to allow all requests. This mode should not be used on any production cluster.
 
## Related resources
Pod
 
## What this control tests 
Do not always authorize all requests.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that the `--authorization-mode` argument exists and is not set to `AlwaysAllow`.
 
## Remediation
Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--authorization-mode` parameter to values other than `AlwaysAllow`. One such example could be as below.

 
```
--authorization-mode=RBAC

```
 
### Impact Statement
Only authorized requests will be served.
 
### Default Value
By default, `AlwaysAllow` is not enabled.
