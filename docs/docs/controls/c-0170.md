## Prerequisites
Kubescape must be run with the [host scanner enabled](../scanning.md#the-host-scanner) to use this control.
## Framework
cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
## Severity
High
## Description of the the issue
The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the `--config` argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

## What does this control test
Ensure that if the kubelet refers to a configuration file with the `--config` argument, that file has permissions of 600 or more restrictive.
## How to check it manually
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

 
```
stat -c %a /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

```
 Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.
## Remediation
Run the following command (using the config file location identied in the Audit step)

 
```
chmod 600 /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

```
### Impact Statement
None
### Default Value
By default, the /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml file as set up by `kubeadm` has permissions of 600.
