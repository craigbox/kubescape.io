## Prerequisites
Kubescape must be run with the [host scanner enabled](../scanning.md#the-host-scanner) to use this control.
## Framework
cis-aks-t1.2.0, cis-eks-t1.2.0, cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
## Severity
High
## Description of the the issue
The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the `--config` argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root.
## Related resources

## What does this control test
Ensure that if the kubelet refers to a configuration file with the `--config` argument, that file is owned by root:root.
## How to check it manually
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

 
```
stat -c %a /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
```Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

```
## Remediation
Run the following command (using the config file location identied in the Audit step)

 
```
chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf

```
### Impact Statement
None
### Default Value
By default, `/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml` file as set up by `kubeadm` is owned by `root:root`.
