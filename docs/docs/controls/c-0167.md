## Severity

## Description of the the issue
The `kubelet.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

```
stat -c %U %G /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf

```
 Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
## Remediation
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

 
```
chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf

```
