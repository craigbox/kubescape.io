# C-0038: Host PID/IPC privileges

## Frameworks

## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
Containers should be isolated from the host machine as much as possible. The hostPID and hostIPC fields in deployment yaml may allow cross-container influence and may expose the host itself to potentially malicious or destructive actions. This control identifies all pods using hostPID or hostIPC privileges.

## What this control tests 
Containers should be isolated from the host machine as much as possible. The hostPID and hostIPC fields in deployment yaml may allow cross-container influence and may expose the host itself to potentially malicious or destructive actions. This control identifies all pods using hostPID or hostIPC privileges.
 
## Remediation
Remove hostPID and hostIPC from the yaml file(s) privileges unless they are absolutely necessary.
 
## Example
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ubuntu
  labels:
    app: ubuntu
spec:
  containers:
  - image: ubuntu
    name: ubuntu
  hostIPC: true # we look for this attribute and 
  hostPID: true # we look for this attribute
```
