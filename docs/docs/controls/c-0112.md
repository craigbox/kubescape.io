# C-0112: Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI key file permissions are set to 600

## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
Kubernetes makes use of a number of key files as part of the operation of its components. The permissions on these files should be set to `600` to protect their integrity and confidentiality.
 
## What this control tests 
Ensure that Kubernetes PKI key files have permissions of `600`.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
ls -laR /etc/kubernetes/pki/*.key

```
 Verify that the permissions are `600`.
 
## Remediation
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
chmod -R 600 /etc/kubernetes/pki/*.key

```
 
### Impact Statement
None
 
### Default Value
By default, the keys used by Kubernetes are set to have permissions of `600`
