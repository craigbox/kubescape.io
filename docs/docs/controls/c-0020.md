# C-0020: Mount service principal

## Prerequisites
 *Integrate with cloud provider (see [here](https://hub.armosec.io/docs/kubescape-integration-with-cloud-providers))*
 
## Frameworks
* MITRE
* AllControls
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
When the cluster is deployed in the cloud, in some cases attackers can leverage their access to a container in the cluster to gain cloud credentials. For example, in AKS each node contains service principal credential.

## What this control tests 
Check which workloads have volumes with potential access to known cloud credentials folders or files in node, like “/etc/kubernetes/azure.json” for Azure.
 
## Remediation
Refrain from using path mount to known cloud credentials folders or files .
 
## Example
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pd
spec:
  containers:
  - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
    name: test-container
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /test-pd
      name: test-volume
  volumes:
  - name: test-volume
    hostPath: # This field triggers failure!
      path: /data
      type: Directory

```
