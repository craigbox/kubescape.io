## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity

## Description of the issue
Container Network Interface provides various networking options for overlay networking. You should consult their documentation and restrict their respective file permissions to maintain the integrity of those files. Those files should be owned by `root:root`.
 
## What this control tests 
Ensure that the Container Network Interface files have ownership set to `root:root`.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
stat -c %U:%G <path/to/cni/files>

```
 Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
 
## Remediation
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
chown root:root <path/to/cni/files>

```
