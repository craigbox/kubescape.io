# C-0155: Ensure that the --auto-tls argument is not set to true

## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should not be available to unauthenticated clients. You should enable the client authentication via valid certificates to secure the access to the etcd service.

## What this control tests 
Do not use self-signed certificates for TLS.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the etcd server node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep etcd

```
 Verify that if the `--auto-tls` argument exists, it is not set to `true`.
 
## Remediation
Edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` on the master node and either remove the `--auto-tls` parameter or set it to `false`.

 
```
--auto-tls=false

```
 
### Impact Statement
Clients will not be able to use self-signed certificates for TLS.
 
### Default Value
By default, `--auto-tls` is set to `false`.
