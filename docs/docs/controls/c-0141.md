## Prerequisites
Kubescape must be run with the [host scanner enabled](/docs/scanning/#the-host-scanner) to use this control.
## Framework
cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
## Severity
High
## Description of the the issue
etcd is a highly available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted at rest to avoid any disclosures.
## Related resources
Pod
## What does this control test
Encrypt etcd key-value store.
## How to check it manually
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that the `--encryption-provider-config` argument is set to a `EncryptionConfig` file. Additionally, ensure that the `EncryptionConfig` file has all the desired `resources` covered especially any secrets.
## Remediation
Follow the Kubernetes documentation and configure a `EncryptionConfig` file. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the `--encryption-provider-config` parameter to the path of that file:

 
```
--encryption-provider-config=</path/to/EncryptionConfig/File>

```
### Impact Statement
None
### Default Value
By default, `--encryption-provider-config` is not set.
## Example
No example
