## Framework
cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
## Severity
Low
## Description of the the issue
When you create a pod, if you do not specify a service account, it is automatically assigned the `default` service account in the same namespace. You should create your own service account and let the API server manage its security tokens.
## Related resources
Pod
## What does this control test
Automate service accounts management.
## How to check it manually
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that the `--disable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that does not includes `ServiceAccount`.
## Remediation
Follow the documentation and create `ServiceAccount` objects as per your environment. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and ensure that the `--disable-admission-plugins` parameter is set to a value that does not include `ServiceAccount`.
### Impact Statement
None.
### Default Value
By default, `ServiceAccount` is set.
