# C-0125: Ensure that the admission control plugin ServiceAccount is set

## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
Low

## Description of the issue
When you create a pod, if you do not specify a service account, it is automatically assigned the `default` service account in the same namespace. You should create your own service account and let the API server manage its security tokens.

## What this control tests 
Automate service accounts management.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that the `--disable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that does not includes `ServiceAccount`.
 
## Remediation
Follow the documentation and create `ServiceAccount` objects as per your environment. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and ensure that the `--disable-admission-plugins` parameter is set to a value that does not include `ServiceAccount`.
 
### Impact Statement
None.
 
### Default Value
By default, `ServiceAccount` is set.
