## Prerequisites
Kubescape must be run with the [host scanner enabled](/docs/scanning/#the-host-scanner) to use this control.
## Framework
cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
## Severity
High
## Description of the the issue
etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should be owned by `etcd:etcd`.
## Related resources

## What does this control test
Ensure that the etcd data directory ownership is set to `etcd:etcd`.
## How to check it manually
On the etcd server node, get the etcd data directory, passed as an argument `--data-dir`, from the below command:

 
```
ps -ef | grep etcd

```
 Run the below command (based on the etcd data directory found above). For example,

 
```
stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/etcd

```
 Verify that the ownership is set to `etcd:etcd`.
## Remediation
On the etcd server node, get the etcd data directory, passed as an argument `--data-dir`, from the below command:

 
```
ps -ef | grep etcd

```
 Run the below command (based on the etcd data directory found above). For example,

 
```
chown etcd:etcd /var/lib/etcd

```
### Impact Statement

### Default Value
By default, etcd data directory ownership is set to `etcd:etcd`.
## Example
