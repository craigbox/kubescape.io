## Framework
cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
## Severity
High
## Description of the the issue
Setting admission control plugin `AlwaysAdmit` allows all requests and do not filter any requests.

 The `AlwaysAdmit` admission controller was deprecated in Kubernetes v1.13. Its behavior was equivalent to turning off all admission controllers.
## Related resources
Pod
## What does this control test
Do not allow all requests.
## How to check it manually
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that if the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set, its value does not include `AlwaysAdmit`.
## Remediation
Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and either remove the `--enable-admission-plugins` parameter, or set it to a value that does not include `AlwaysAdmit`.
### Impact Statement
Only requests explicitly allowed by the admissions control plugins would be served.
### Default Value
`AlwaysAdmit` is not in the list of default admission plugins.
## Example
No example
