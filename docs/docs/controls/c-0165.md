## Prerequisites
Kubescape must be run with the [host scanner enabled](/docs/scanning/#the-host-scanner) to use this control.
## Framework
cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
## Severity
Medium
## Description of the the issue
The kubeconfig file for `kube-proxy` controls various parameters for the `kube-proxy` service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.
## Related resources

## What does this control test
If `kube-proxy` is running, ensure that the file ownership of its kubeconfig file is set to `root:root`.
## How to check it manually
Find the kubeconfig file being used by `kube-proxy` by running the following command:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-proxy

```
 If `kube-proxy` is running, get the kubeconfig file location from the `--kubeconfig` parameter.

 To perform the audit:

 Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

 
```
stat -c %U:%G <path><filename>

```
 Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
## Remediation
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

 
```
chown root:root <proxy kubeconfig file>

```
### Impact Statement
None
### Default Value
By default, `proxy` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
## Example
No example
