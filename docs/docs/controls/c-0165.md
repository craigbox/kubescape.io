# C-0165: If proxy kubeconfig file exists ensure ownership is set to root:root

## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
The kubeconfig file for `kube-proxy` controls various parameters for the `kube-proxy` service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.
 
## What this control tests 
If `kube-proxy` is running, ensure that the file ownership of its kubeconfig file is set to `root:root`.
 
## How to check it manually 
Find the kubeconfig file being used by `kube-proxy` by running the following command:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-proxy

```
 If `kube-proxy` is running, get the kubeconfig file location from the `--kubeconfig` parameter.

 To perform the audit:

 Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

 
```
stat -c %U:%G <path><filename>

```
 Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
 
## Remediation
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

 
```
chown root:root <proxy kubeconfig file>

```
 
### Impact Statement
None
 
### Default Value
By default, `proxy` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
