## Description of the issue
We have it in Armo best (Automatic mapping of service account token).
 
## Related resources
CronJob, DaemonSet, Deployment, Job, Pod, ReplicaSet, ServiceAccount, StatefulSet
 
## What this control tests 
Check all service accounts on which automount is not disabled.  Check all workloads on which they and their service account don't disable automount 
 
## Remediation
Disable automatic mounting of service account tokens to pods either at the service account level or at the individual pod level, by specifying the automountServiceAccountToken: false. Note that pod level takes precedence.
 
## Example
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: build-robot
automountServiceAccountToken: false # we look for this attribute
```
