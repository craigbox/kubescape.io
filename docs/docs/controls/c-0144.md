## Framework
cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
## Severity
Medium
## Description of the the issue
Garbage collection is important to ensure sufficient resource availability and avoiding degraded performance and availability. In the worst case, the system might crash or just be unusable for a long period of time. The current setting for garbage collection is 12,500 terminated pods which might be too high for your system to sustain. Based on your system resources and tests, choose an appropriate threshold value to activate garbage collection.
## Related resources
Pod
## What does this control test
Activate garbage collector on pod termination, as appropriate.
## How to check it manually
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager

```
 Verify that the `--terminated-pod-gc-threshold` argument is set as appropriate.
## Remediation
Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--terminated-pod-gc-threshold` to an appropriate threshold, for example:

 
```
--terminated-pod-gc-threshold=10

```
### Impact Statement
None
### Default Value
By default, `--terminated-pod-gc-threshold` is set to `12500`.
## Example
