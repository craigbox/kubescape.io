## What does this control test

## Remediation
Only connect PODs to host network when it is necessary. If not, set the hostNetwork field of the pod spec to false, or completely remove it (false is the default). Whitelist only those PODs that must have access to host network by design.
## Example
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ubuntu
  labels:
    app: ubuntu
spec:
  containers:
  - image: ubuntu
    name: ubuntu
  hostNetwork: true # we look for this attribute 

```
