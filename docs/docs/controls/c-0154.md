## Framework
cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
## Severity
High
## Description of the the issue
etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should not be available to unauthenticated clients. You should enable the client authentication via valid certificates to secure the access to the etcd service.

Pod
## What does this control test
Enable client authentication on etcd service.
## How to check it manually
Run the following command on the etcd server node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep etcd

```
 Verify that the `--client-cert-auth` argument is set to `true`.
## Remediation
Edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` on the master node and set the below parameter.

 
```
--client-cert-auth="true"

```
### Impact Statement
All clients attempting to access the etcd server will require a valid client certificate.
### Default Value
By default, the etcd service can be queried by unauthenticated clients.
