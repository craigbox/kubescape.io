## Framework
cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
## Severity
High
## Description of the the issue
Kubernetes makes use of a number of certificate files as part of the operation of its components. The permissions on these files should be set to `600` or more restrictive to protect their integrity.

## What does this control test
Ensure that Kubernetes PKI certificate files have permissions of `600` or more restrictive.
## How to check it manually
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
ls -laR /etc/kubernetes/pki/*.crt

```
 Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.
## Remediation
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

 
```
chmod -R 600 /etc/kubernetes/pki/*.crt

```
### Impact Statement
None
### Default Value
By default, the certificates used by Kubernetes are set to have permissions of `644`
