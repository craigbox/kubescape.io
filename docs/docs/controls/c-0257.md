## What this control tests 
Check if any workload has mounted PVCs by inspecting their specifications and verifying if PVC volumes are defined
 
## Remediation
Review the workloads identified by this control and assess whether it's necessary to mount these PVCs. Remove PVC access from workloads that don't require it or ensure appropriate access controls are in place to protect sensitive information.
