# C-0166: Ensure that the --kubeconfig kubelet.conf file permissions are set to 600 or more restrictive

## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
The `kubelet.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
 
## What this control tests 
Ensure that the `kubelet.conf` file has permissions of `600` or more restrictive.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

 
```
stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf

```
 Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.
 
## Remediation
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

 
```
chmod 600 /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf

```
 
### Impact Statement
None
 
### Default Value
By default, `kubelet.conf` file has permissions of `600`.
