## Description of the the issue
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a key security feature in Kubernetes. RBAC can restrict the allowed actions of the various identities in the cluster. Cluster-admin is a built-in high privileged role in Kubernetes. Attackers who have permissions to create bindings and cluster-bindings in the cluster can create a binding to the cluster-admin ClusterRole or to other high privileges roles.

## What does this control test
Check which subjects have cluster-admin RBAC permissions â€“ either by being bound to the cluster-admin clusterrole, or by having equivalent high privileges.  
## Remediation
You should apply least privilege principle. Make sure cluster admin permissions are granted only when it is absolutely necessary. Don't use subjects with such high permissions for daily operations.
