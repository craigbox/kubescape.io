## Framework
cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
## Severity
High
## Description of the the issue
Auditing the Kubernetes API Server provides a security-relevant chronological set of records documenting the sequence of activities that have affected system by individual users, administrators or other components of the system. Even though currently, Kubernetes provides only basic audit capabilities, it should be enabled. You can enable it by setting an appropriate audit log path.
## Related resources
Pod
## What does this control test
Enable auditing on the Kubernetes API Server and set the desired audit log path.
## How to check it manually
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that the `--audit-log-path` argument is set as appropriate.
## Remediation
Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--audit-log-path` parameter to a suitable path and file where you would like audit logs to be written, for example:

 
```
--audit-log-path=/var/log/apiserver/audit.log

```
### Impact Statement
None
### Default Value
By default, auditing is not enabled.
## Example
No example
