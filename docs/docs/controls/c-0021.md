## Framework
AllControls, MITRE
## Severity
Medium
## Description of the the issue
Exposing a sensitive interface to the internet poses a security risk. Some popular frameworks were not intended to be exposed to the internet, and therefore donâ€™t require authentication by default. Thus, exposing them to the internet allows unauthenticated access to a sensitive interface which might enable running code or deploying containers in the cluster by a malicious actor. Examples of such interfaces that were seen exploited include Apache NiFi, Kubeflow, Argo Workflows, Weave Scope, and the Kubernetes dashboard.Note, this control is configurable. See below the details.

## What does this control test
Checking if a service of type nodeport/loadbalancer to one of the known exploited interfaces (Apache NiFi, Kubeflow, Argo Workflows, Weave Scope Kubernetes dashboard) exists. Needs to add user config
## Remediation
Consider blocking external interfaces or protect them with appropriate security tools.
## Configuration
This control can be configured using the following parameters. Read CLI/UI documentation about how to change parameters.
### Service names
[servicesNames](doc:configuration_parameter_servicesnames)
Kubescape will look for the following services that exposes sensitive interfaces of common K8s projects/applications
### Sensitive interfaces
[sensitiveInterfaces](doc:configuration_parameter_sensitiveinterfaces)
The following interfaces were seen exploited. Kubescape checks it they are externally exposed.
## Example
No example
