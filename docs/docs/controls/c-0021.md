# C-0021: Exposed sensitive interfaces

## Frameworks
* MITRE
* AllControls
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
Exposing a sensitive interface to the internet poses a security risk. Some popular frameworks were not intended to be exposed to the internet, and therefore donâ€™t require authentication by default. Thus, exposing them to the internet allows unauthenticated access to a sensitive interface which might enable running code or deploying containers in the cluster by a malicious actor. Examples of such interfaces that were seen exploited include Apache NiFi, Kubeflow, Argo Workflows, Weave Scope, and the Kubernetes dashboard. Note, [this control is configurable](#configuration-parameters).

## What this control tests 
Checking if a service of type nodeport/loadbalancer to one of the known exploited interfaces (Apache NiFi, Kubeflow, Argo Workflows, Weave Scope Kubernetes dashboard) exists. Needs to add user config
 
## Remediation
Consider blocking external interfaces or protect them with appropriate security tools.
 
## Configuration parameters 
 You can adjust the configuration of this control to suit your specific environment. [Read the documentation on configuring controls](../frameworks-and-controls/configuring-controls.md) to learn more.
