stat -c %a /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf

```
 Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
## Remediation
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

chown root:root /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/kubeadm.conf

```
