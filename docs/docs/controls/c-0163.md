# C-0163: Ensure that the kubelet service file ownership is set to root:root

## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
Medium

## Description of the issue
The `kubelet` service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `kubelet` service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.
 
## What this control tests 
Ensure that the `kubelet` service file ownership is set to `root:root`.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

 
```
stat -c %a /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf

```
 Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
 
## Remediation
Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

 
```
chown root:root /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/kubeadm.conf

```
 
### Impact Statement
None
 
### Default Value
By default, `kubelet` service file ownership is set to `root:root`.
