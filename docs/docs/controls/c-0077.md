## Frameworks

## Severity
Low

## Description of the issue
Kubernetes common labels help manage and monitor Kubernetes cluster using different tools such as kubectl, dashboard and others in an interoperable way. Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/ for more information. This control helps you find objects that don't have any of these labels defined. [This control is configurable](#configuration-parameters).

## What this control tests 
Test will check if the list of label that start with app.kubernetes.io/ are defined.
 
## Remediation
Define applicable labels or use the exception mechanism to prevent further notifications.
 
## Configuration parameters
You can adjust the configuration of this control to suit your specific environment. [Read the documentation on configuring controls](../../frameworks-and-controls/configuring-controls/) to learn more.

* [Kubernetes Recommended Labels](../../frameworks-and-controls/configuring-controls/#k8srecommendedlabels): Kubescape checks that workloads have at least one of this list of configurable labels, as recommended in the Kubernetes documentation.
