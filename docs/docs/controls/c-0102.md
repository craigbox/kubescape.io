## What does this control test
Ensure that the etcd data directory has permissions of `700` or more restrictive.
## How to check it manually
On the etcd server node, get the etcd data directory, passed as an argument `--data-dir`, from the below command:

 
```
ps -ef | grep etcd

```
 Run the below command (based on the etcd data directory found above). For example,

 
```
stat -c %a /var/lib/etcd

```
 Verify that the permissions are `700` or more restrictive.
## Remediation
On the etcd server node, get the etcd data directory, passed as an argument `--data-dir`, from the below command:

 
```

```
 Run the below command (based on the etcd data directory found above). For example,

 
```
chmod 700 /var/lib/etcd

```
