# C-0046: Insecure capabilities

## Frameworks

## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
Giving  insecure and unnecessary capabilities for a container can increase the impact of a container compromise. [This control is configurable](#configuration-parameters).
 
## Related resources
CronJob, DaemonSet, Deployment, Job, Pod, ReplicaSet, StatefulSet
 
## What this control tests 
Check capabilities given against a configurable blacklist of insecure capabilities (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html). 
 
## Remediation
Remove all insecure capabilities which are not necessary for the container.
 
## Configuration parameters
You can adjust the configuration of this control to suit your specific environment. [Read the documentation on configuring controls](../../frameworks-and-controls/configuring-controls/) to learn more.

* [Insecure capabilities](../../frameworks-and-controls/configuring-controls/#insecurecapabilities): Kubescape looks for these capabilities in containers, which might lead to attackers getting elevated privileges in your cluster. You can see the full list of possible capabilities at https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html.

## Example
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: security-context-demo-4
spec:
  containers:
  - name: sec-ctx-4
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["NET_ADMIN", "SYS_TIME"] # we look at these capabilities against the configured list in the control settings (settings-> control -> c46)
```
