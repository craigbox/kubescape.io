# C-0114: Ensure that the API Server --token-auth-file parameter is not set

## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
The token-based authentication utilizes static tokens to authenticate requests to the apiserver. The tokens are stored in clear-text in a file on the apiserver, and cannot be revoked or rotated without restarting the apiserver. Hence, do not use static token-based authentication.
 
## Related resources
Pod
 
## What this control tests 
Do not use token based authentication.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Verify that the `--token-auth-file` argument does not exist.
 
## Remediation
Follow the documentation and configure alternate mechanisms for authentication. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and remove the `--token-auth-file=<filename>` parameter.
 
### Impact Statement
You will have to configure and use alternate authentication mechanisms such as certificates. Static token based authentication could not be used.
 
### Default Value
By default, `--token-auth-file` argument is not set.
