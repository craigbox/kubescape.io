# C-0142: Ensure that encryption providers are appropriately configured

## Prerequisites
 *Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](https://hub.armo.cloud/docs/host-sensor))*
 
## Framework
* cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the issue
Where `etcd` encryption is used, it is important to ensure that the appropriate set of encryption providers is used. Currently, the `aescbc`, `kms` and `secretbox` are likely to be appropriate options.
 
## What this control tests 
Where `etcd` encryption is used, appropriate providers should be configured.
 
## How to check it manually 
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Get the `EncryptionConfig` file set for `--encryption-provider-config` argument. Verify that `aescbc`, `kms` or `secretbox` is set as the encryption provider for all the desired `resources`.
 
## Remediation
Follow the Kubernetes documentation and configure a `EncryptionConfig` file. In this file, choose `aescbc`, `kms` or `secretbox` as the encryption provider.
 
### Impact Statement
None
 
### Default Value
By default, no encryption provider is set.
