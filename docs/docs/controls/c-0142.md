## Prerequisites
Kubescape must be run with the [host scanner enabled](/docs/scanning/#the-host-scanner) to use this control.
## Framework
cis-v1.23-t1.0.1
## Severity
High
## Description of the the issue
Where `etcd` encryption is used, it is important to ensure that the appropriate set of encryption providers is used. Currently, the `aescbc`, `kms` and `secretbox` are likely to be appropriate options.
## Related resources

## What does this control test
Where `etcd` encryption is used, appropriate providers should be configured.
## How to check it manually
Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

 
```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```
 Get the `EncryptionConfig` file set for `--encryption-provider-config` argument. Verify that `aescbc`, `kms` or `secretbox` is set as the encryption provider for all the desired `resources`.
## Remediation
Follow the Kubernetes documentation and configure a `EncryptionConfig` file. In this file, choose `aescbc`, `kms` or `secretbox` as the encryption provider.
### Impact Statement
None
### Default Value
By default, no encryption provider is set.
## Example
No example
