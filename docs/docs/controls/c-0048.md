## What this control tests

## Remediation
Remove hostPath mounts unless they are absolutely necessary and use exception mechanism to remove notifications.
 
## Example
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pd
spec:
  containers:
  - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
    name: test-container
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /test-pd
      name: test-volume
  volumes:
  - name: test-volume
    hostPath: # This field triggers failure!
      path: /data
      type: Directory

```
