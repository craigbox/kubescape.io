_An open-source Kubernetes security platform for your IDE, CI/CD pipelines, and clusters_

Kubescape is an open-source Kubernetes security platform. It includes risk analysis, security compliance, and misconfiguration scanning. Targeted at the DevSecOps practitioner or platform engineer, it offers an easy-to-use CLI interface, flexible output formats, and automated scanning capabilities. It saves Kubernetes users and admins precious time, effort, and resources.

Kubescape scans clusters, YAML files, and Helm charts. It detects misconfigurations according to multiple frameworks (including [NSA-CISA](https://www.armosec.io/blog/kubernetes-hardening-guidance-summary-by-armo/?utm_source=kubescape.io&utm_medium=website), [MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/23/secure-containerized-environments-with-updated-threat-matrix-for-kubernetes/) and the [CIS Benchmark](https://www.armosec.io/blog/cis-kubernetes-benchmark-framework-scanning-tools-comparison/?utm_source=kubescape.io&utm_medium=website)).

Kubescape was created by [ARMO](https://www.armosec.io/?utm_source=kubescape.io&utm_medium=website) and is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) sandbox project](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/).

_Please [star ‚≠ê](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/stargazers) the repo if you want us to continue developing and improving Kubescape! üòÄ_

## Getting started

Experimenting with Kubescape is as easy as:

``` sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubescape/kubescape/master/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

Learn more about:

* [Installing Kubescape](docs/getting-started.md/#install-kubescape)

## Under the hood

Kubescape uses [Open Policy Agent](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) to verify Kubernetes objects against [a library of posture controls](docs/frameworks-and-controls/index.md).

By default, the results are printed in a console-friendly manner, but they can be:

* exported to JSON or junit XML
* rendered to HTML or PDF
* submitted to a [Kubescape-compatible provider](docs/providers.md)

## Community

Kubescape is an open source project, we welcome your feedback and ideas for improvement. We are part of the Kubernetes community and are building more tests and controls as the ecosystem develops.

We hold [community meetings](project/community.md#monthly-meeting) every month.

The Kubescape project follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
